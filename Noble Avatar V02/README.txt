The following is a set of avatar components I use in Age of Conquest (http://www.ageofconquest.com). I get a lot of request from people asking me to use the avatars in their own projects, so here you go :)

I hope the graphics come in handy for someone. Oh and yes, there are over 15 Trillion avatar combinations if you layer them correctly :-D

PS I: To play around with it, you can also visit the Noble Avatar website (http://www.nobleavatar.com/).
PS II: I included the source code too for the application that is on the Noble Avatar website if you are confused as to how to use the avatar components but I don't think you really need it. Although the source is in Java, you should be able to get the avatars to work in any other language/game developer's too.

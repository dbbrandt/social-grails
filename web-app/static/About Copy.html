							<h2>Why ESMZone?</h2>
						</div>
						<div class="main-content">
							<p>ESMZone is where athletes are part of a community, simply by joining.  Every member has something in common - all are Student Athletes.</p>
							<p>Kids get involved with sports at all ages – initially to socialize with friends - later to compete and test their skills.  As skills develop, excitement and enjoyment grow.  Over time, enthusiasm for playing and a commitment to their teammates develop.
								ESMZone is for everyone who participates in sports and wants to bring their best game to the challenges of being a student.</p>
							<p>Passion is often used to describe an athlete’s approach to preparation, the game, and life itself.  ESMzone is built by people who share that passion. We believe character and integrity developed through sports are fundamental to success as an athlete, in school and throughout life. True leaders make their teams and athletes around them better.  The way they compete is as important as their athletic ability.  Their influence raises the level of those around them.   
								The ESMZone competition was designed to reward the type of positive participation exemplified by the best leaders in sports.</p>
